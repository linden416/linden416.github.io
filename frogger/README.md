Description

    This project features JavaScript Object Oriented programming.
    The code including the game engine and images were cloned from
    GitHub leaving skeleton classes and missing functionality. I
    implented the classes and added new functionality.

    The player moves about the canvas playing grid using arrow keys.
    The player avoids collisions with the enemy bugs. However, if
    a collision occurs, the player is sent back to starting position.

Instructions

    The object of the game is to successfully cross the pavement to
    the water without touching an enemy bug. The bugs will be moving
    at different speeds and changing their paths. The arrow keys are
    to be used to move left/right, forward/back toward the water.

    Upon successfully reaching the water, you have succeeded! The game 
    will pause then automatically reset for another game.

    If the player collides with the enemy bug, the game pauses to reflect
    the casualty of the collision, then resets to a new game.

Installation

    Use the GitHub link to copy the source locally. Open the index.html 
    file in the browser to start the game.
